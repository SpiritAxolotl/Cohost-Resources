# Cohost Resources
A collection of resources for all things Cohost!

> What is cohost? <https://cohost.org>

> [!NOTE]
> This repository is in its infancy. There's no established format or flow with anything (yet), so I'll try to figure out what works the best over the coming days.  
> Any and all help with establishing the format would be greatly appreciated!

## Rationale
Cohost is a great social media platform that gives its users a generous amount of flexibility, but, like other communities, its resources and related information are scattered across the site and the rest of the internet, with no real unifying factor. This repository aims to be that conclusive comprehensive resource for anything relating to Cohost.

## Contributing
This repository shouldn't need to have dependencies. I want to keep it as "working-out-of-the-box" as possible. You should just be able to make a new markdown file in the appropriate directory (or edit an existing file). And then just make a pull request!

## Discussion
I've set up a GitHub discussions with the default template for it. I plan for it to evolve alongside this repository.
